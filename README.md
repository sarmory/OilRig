# OilRig
PowerBi Custom Visual for showing oil rig drill depths.

This is something of an apprentice piece, please bear this in mind when reviewing the code.

Fairly simplistic visual using an image for the oil rig, d3 axis, svg, rectangles for the shapes.

Data is passed / used from the tables.

Passed data is limied to 4 numerics (Drill Depth, Drill Sections, Target Drill Depth, Sea Depth)
